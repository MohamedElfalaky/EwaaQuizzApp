1- stateless widget (قراءة فقط)
a widget that does not need to be re-rendered because the user doent need to interact with
ودجت لا يحتاج اعادة رسمه لانه لا يتفاعل مع المستخدم (صفحة الشروط والاحكام)



2- statefull widget
a widget that needs to be re-rendered because the user will need to interact with
 so the "State" needs to be change and rerenderd on the screen



build function : its a function inside stateless and statefull widgets used to paint (render ) the UI.

set state finction :
- it is a fuction inside statefull widget used to re-render the screen (UI) with the new "state"
- its a fuction that calls the build function


- splash screen :the screen that appears first and still for about 2 second 


- Responsive design: is to make a design that is fit with all screen sizes
